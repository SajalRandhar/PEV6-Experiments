# PEV6-Experiments


## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

The goal of this project is to **automate risk evaluation** for motor insurance by focusing on high-impact segments. Specifically, the objectives are:

1. **Higher-End Cars**
   Identify and assess the risk associated with luxury or high-value vehicles that typically carry higher exposure.

2. **Car Age: 16â€“20 Years**
   Evaluate aging vehicles that may present elevated mechanical and claim risks due to wear and tear.

3. **New Cars**
   Analyze risk behavior for brand-new vehicles, where lack of historical data and higher repair costs play a role.

4. **Third-Party (TP) Claims**
   Assess risk trends and outliers in third-party claims to flag potentially fraudulent or loss-heavy policies.
